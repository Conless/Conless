### Hi there ~ <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="24px" alt="hi">

I'm Yi Pan, currently an undergraduate at the SJTU ACM Class. It's great to see you here! üòÑ

- My research interests mainly lie in computer systems, especially effective computer architecture and machine learning systems.
- I'm currently working on [remire OS](https://github.com/Conless/remire) (will be made public after this semester), an efficient microkernel written in Rust.
- I focus on building computer systems with practical applications or educational value. Some of my recent projects are:
  - [Gelato GPU](https://github.com/dolce-project/gelato), a general-purpose GPU supporting RISC-V ISA with a custom SIMT extension.
  - [CachedLLM](https://github.com/Conless/CachedLLM), an LLM serving system built on top of vLLM with dynamic page cache.
  - [Comet Compiler](https://github.com/Conless/comet), a compiler for Mx (a C-like programming language for educational purposes).
