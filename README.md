### Hi there ~ <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="24px" alt="hi">

I’m Yi Pan, a senior undergraduate from SJTU ACM Class, caffeine enthusiast, and systems tinkerer. Thanks for dropping by! 😄

- Currently I'm a research intern at UW [Systems Lab](https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/) / [SyFI](https://syfi.cs.washington.edu) / [efeslab](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~baris/team/), where I get paid (in coffee) and do research in datacenter systems and systems for machine learning.
- I’m eternally curious about building efficient, scalable, reliable systems that (may or may not) behave as intended. Some of the recent systems I built include [Nanoflow](https://github.com/efeslab/Nanoflow) and [eProf](https://github.com/uw-syfi/eProf).
- I'm passionate about contributing to the open-source community! I've been fortunate to contribute to several amazing open-source projects, including [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch), [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang), [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org) and [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project).
- When I’m not hunting segfaults/core dumps/CUDA OOM, I also love to build fun side projects, including [LLMc](https://github.com/uw-syfi/LLMc), [Remire OS](https://github.com/Conless/remire), [Gelato GPU](https://github.com/dolce-project/gelato), [CachedLLM](https://github.com/Conless/CachedLLM), [Comet Compiler](https://github.com/Conless/comet).
