### Hi there ~ <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="24px" alt="hi">

I'm Yi Pan, a junior undergraduate from SJTU ACM Class. It's great to see you here! 😄

- Aiming to build efficient, scalable, and reliable systems, I have broad research interests in computer systems. My current research mainly focuses on distributed systems and systems for machine learning.
- I'm passionate about contributing to the open-source community! I've been fortunate to contribute to several amazing open-source projects, including [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch), [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org) and [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project).
- Some of my previous projects include:
  - [Remire OS](https://github.com/Conless/remire), an efficient microkernel written in Rust.
  - [Gelato GPU](https://github.com/dolce-project/gelato), a general-purpose GPU supporting RISC-V ISA with a custom SIMT extension.
  - [CachedLLM](https://github.com/Conless/CachedLLM), an LLM serving system built on top of vLLM with dynamic page cache.
  - [Comet Compiler](https://github.com/Conless/comet), a compiler for Mx (a C-like programming language for educational purposes).
